## Current System State

### Remaining Features
The system now focuses on core compliance management features:

1. **Dashboard** - Main overview and metrics
2. **Gap Analysis** - ISO 27001:2022 compliance tracking
3. **Schedules** - Recurring compliance tasks
4. **Requirements** - ISO standard requirements management
5. **Action Plans** - Corrective action tracking
6. **Risk Register** - Risk assessment and management
7. **Evidence** - Document and evidence management

### Removed Features
- **Incidents** - Incident reporting and management
- **Analytics** - Advanced analytics and reporting
- **Team** - Team management functionality

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- **Simplified Navigation** - Cleaner, more focused user interface
- **Reduced Complexity** - Fewer modules to maintain and test
- **Streamlined Database** - Smaller schema with fewer relationships
- **Focused Functionality** - Core compliance features remain intact

### Considerations
- **Data Loss** - All incident data has been permanently removed
- **API Endpoints** - All incident-related API endpoints are no longer available
- **Email Notifications** - Incident notification emails are no longer sent

## Verification

### Backend Status
- ✅ Backend server running successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ Prisma client regenerated

### Frontend Status
- ✅ Navigation updated
- ✅ No broken links
- ✅ Clean interface without removed features

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for use with the streamlined feature set. All core compliance management functionality remains intact and operational.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Test Core Features** - Verify all remaining features work correctly
2. **Update Documentation** - Remove references to incidents and analytics
3. **User Training** - Inform users about the simplified interface
4. **Backup Strategy** - Ensure proper backups are in place
