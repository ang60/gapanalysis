## üöÄ **New API Endpoints**

### **Requirements Management**
```bash
# Get requirements by clause
GET /requirements/clause/{clause}

# Get requirements by category
GET /requirements/category/{category}

# Get requirements by section
GET /requirements/section/{section}

# Get requirements with gap assessments
GET /requirements/clause/{clause}/branch/{branchId}/assessments

# Get compliance statistics
GET /requirements/clause/{clause}/branch/{branchId}/compliance-stats

# Get "What's Missing" report
GET /requirements/clause/{clause}/branch/{branchId}/whats-missing

# Get incomplete requirements
GET /requirements/incomplete/branch/{branchId}
```

### **Example Usage**
```bash
# Get all Clause 7.3 (Awareness) requirements
GET /requirements/clause/7.3

# Get all ISO 27001 requirements
GET /requirements/category/ISO 27001

# Get all Annex A requirements
GET /requirements/section/Annex A

# Get compliance stats for Clause 7.3 in Branch 1

## üìä **Compliance Status Scale**

### **Implementation Status (0-3 Scale)**
- **0 - Not Implemented**: Requirement not addressed
- **1 - Partially Implemented**: Some aspects implemented
- **2 - Mostly Implemented**: Most aspects implemented
- **3 - Fully Implemented**: Complete implementation with evidence

### **Priority Levels**
- **Critical**: Must implement first (15 requirements)
- **High**: Important for compliance (21 requirements)
- **Medium**: Standard implementation (5 requirements)
- **Low**: Optional or supplementary

## üè¶ **Kenyan Banking Use Cases**

### **Scenario 1: Clause 7.3 - Awareness Training**
```bash
# Get awareness requirements
GET /requirements/clause/7.3

# Check compliance status
GET /requirements/clause/7.3/branch/1/compliance-stats

# Generate missing items report
GET /requirements/clause/7.3/branch/1/whats-missing
```

**Expected Output**:
- Total requirements: 1
- Implementation percentage: 0% (if not implemented)
- Missing items: Gap assessment, evidence, action plan

### **Scenario 2: Annex A - Information Security Controls**
```bash
# Get all Annex A requirements
GET /requirements/section/Annex A

# Get critical Annex A requirements
GET /requirements/section/Annex A?priority=critical
```

**Expected Output**:
- Total requirements: 19
- Critical requirements: 6 (A.5.1, A.9.1, A.9.2, A.13.1, A.16.1, A.18.1)

### **Scenario 3: Clause 8 - Operation**
```bash
